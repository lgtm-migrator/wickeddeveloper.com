I'm a Brazilian who got lost in Montana.  I am passionate about privacy and the decentralized web.  I currently work at [delphidigital.io](https://www.delphiditital.io?ref=luiz) as a Software Engineer.  Whenever I am not on the computer you can find me: fly fishing, river surfing, practicing Yoga, practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or doing one of the many outdoor activities in Montana.
