The [Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (EARN IT) Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s3398) is a bill that would allow the government to ban encryption on commercial services. It has been introduced into the 116th Congress by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). 

If passed, this bill would grant the federal government sweeping powers to force online platforms and services to screen users' speech and build backdoors into their software. 

This bill would put millions at risk, because we live in a world where data is money and your private information is not safe. Its' proponents are claiming that it would protect children from predators, but it really is a ploy to force companies to break their encryption schemes. 

We must act now and tell Congress to reject this bill, you can do that by [contacting your representative](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/dont-let-congress-kill-encryption/) and letting them know you oppose the EARN IT Act.
